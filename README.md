# Background & Motivation
Being an Army Officer, physical readiness is paramount; you have to keep your body in good shape to meet the requirements of the profession. Exercise plays a key role in maintaining physical fitness, but the things you consume are equally important. Nicotine use is widespread among officers, non-commissioned officers and soldiers alike and I am concerned about what negative impacts this might have on health. Because of this, I wanted to examine the effects of nicotine use on blood pressure.

# Questions
<ul>
	<li>How does nicotine affect the likelihood that someone has high blood pressure?</li>
	<li>What other health factors have an effect on this likelihood?</li>
</ul>

# Data
The data I used for this project comes from the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/cdc/national-health-and-nutrition-examination-survey">2013-2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)</a>, an annual survey conducted by the CDC. The survey contains information about participants from 15 different counties across the United States. The data combines medical questionnaire answers as well as medical examinations and labs. The data was broken up into 6 files:
<ul>
	<li>"demographic": 47 columns, 10176 rows</li>
	<li>"diet": 168 columns, 9814 rows</li>
	<li>"examination": 224 columns, 9814 rows</li>
	<li>"labs": 424 columns, 9814 rows</li>
	<li>"medications": 13 columns, 20195 rows</li>
	<li>"questionnaire": 953 columns, 10176 rows</li>
</ul>
Obviously, I couldn't include every column in my analysis, so I decided to focus on participants' ages, genders, blood pressure, and a few of their questionnaire answers dealing with blood pressure. This resulted in the data below:

## <u>Summary of the Data:</u>
1000 Rows, each containing the following information for one unique movie:
<ul>
	<li>Rank: Ranking of Movie based on Opening Weekend Revenue (Numerical)</li>
</ul>

## <u>Cleaning:</u>
<ul>
	<li>I first selected the columns that I wanted to focus on and removed the rest.</li>
	<li>Initially, all categorical column entries were recorded as integers representing participant responses. I found a website that had a legend that explained each number, then I replaced all the numbers with more readable text.</li>
</ul>
